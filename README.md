# Workout_Tracker

## Discription:

Workout Tracker is a full stack application that uses mongoDB as the database to store a user's workouts and exercises. The application provides different types of functionality that will allow the user to track new exercises in an exsisting workout, add new workouts and exercises as well as view workout time durations and totalled weights of their workouts. The front end was provided as starter code and our task was to connect the front end to MongoDB in order to store user's workouts and access them later on.
